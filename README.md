# Phoenix docker image

This `Dockerfile` enables you to create your own Phoenix docker image using the
latest version of both Phoenix and npm (which is installed via node).

This `Dockerfile` is based on [zamith/elixir](https://github.com/zamith/elixir-docker)
docker image which provides everything needed on the Erlang and Elixir front.
